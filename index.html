        <p>The alto flute is an instrument in the Western concert flute family,  C flute after the uncommon fl√ªte d'amour. It is the third most common member of its family after the standard C flute and the piccolo. It is characterized by its rich, mellow tone in the lower portion of its range. Unlike the flute and piccolo, it is a transposing instrument in G .</p>

        <h2>$900</h2>
        <p>The bass flute is a member of the flute family. It is in the key of C, pitched one octave below the concert flute. Despite its name, its playing range makes it the tenor member of the flute family. Because of the length of its tube (approximately 146 cm (57 in)), it is usually made with a J-shaped head joint, which brings the embouchure hole within reach of the player.</p>
